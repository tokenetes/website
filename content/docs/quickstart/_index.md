Welcome to the Tokenetes quickstart guide. This tutorial will guide you through setting up the sample application and observing Tokenetes in action.

Tokenetes is an open source implementation of the [IETF OAuth Transaction Tokens (TraTs) draft specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-transaction-tokens/).

## Deployment

Follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/tokenetes/example-application/blob/main/README.md) of the example application to deploy the application.

After successful deployment, you will see a running `tconfigd` pod in the `tokenetes-system` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get pod -n tokenetes-system
```

Output:

```bash
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
tconfigd-7c94fd755b-b5tjh   1/1     Running   0          49s
```

You will also see `Tokenetes` service pods in the application namespace, which is `alpha-stocks-dev`:

```bash
kubectl get pod -n alpha-stocks-dev | grep tokenetes
```

Output:

```bash
tokenetes-7789594688-b8jjq   1/1     Running   0          67s
```

## TraTs

The example application has four APIs, and TraTs for each API can be found [here](https://github.com/tokenetes/example-application/tree/main/deploy/alpha-stocks-dev/trats).

These TraTs are applied when the application is deployed. You can list them with the following command:

```bash
kubectl get trats -n alpha-stocks-dev
```

Output:

```bash
NAME                      STATUS   AGE    RETRIES
stock-details-api-trat    DONE     118s   0
stock-holdings-api-trat   DONE     118s   0
stock-search-api-trat     DONE     118s   0
stock-trade-api-trat      DONE     118s   0
```

To check the contents of a specific TraT, use:

```bash
kubectl describe trats/stock-trade-api-trat -n alpha-stocks-dev
```

Output:

```bash

## Observing TraTs in Action

To see TraTs in action, launch the example application frontend, which interactively shows the generated TraTs for each invoked external API.

1. Launch the frontend client application as per the example application [README](https://github.com/tokenetes/example-application/blob/main/README.md).

2. Enter [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) in your browser.

3. You will see a Dex authentication page similar to the one shown below:

<img src="/img/docs/introduction/ui-dex-auth-page.png" alt="What Is a TraT" class="doc-image">

4. Authenticate with any user from [here](https://github.com/tokenetes/example-application/blob/main/deploy/alpha-stocks-dev/configs/dex-config.yaml) with the default password of `password123`. For example, you can use the username `sherlock@detect.com` with password `password123`.

5. After authentication, as you navigate through the application, you will see the generated TraTs for the invoked external APIs. Below is a sample page:

## Next Steps

To set up TraTs in your own microservices application, proceed to [Installing Tokenetes](/docs/installation).
